# pyzig
Build system for Python extensions written in Zig.

## Python and Zig: A Heavenly Match
## üêç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ö°
This extension provides a build system for writing Python extensions in Zig.


### Why write extensions in Zig?
TODO

### Can I convert an existing C-Extension to Zig?
TODO

### HPy support
pyzig supports using all 3 ABI modes of the HPy interface. Just specify which ABI your extension uses.

### Setuptools integration
pyzig uses, but does not rely on, setuptools for building extensions. If your extension uses setuptools, pyzig provides easy integration. If you don't use setuptools, then pyzig doesn't require that you do!
